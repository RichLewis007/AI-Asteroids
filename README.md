## Try it here!
[Play AI-Asteroids in your web browser](https://ai-asteroids.richlewis007.com/)

> **Note:** AI features are **disabled** in this public web version to prevent triggering billing on the developer's Gemini API key. 

## Description
- Fly through space in your web browser, shooting asteroids and bad guys!
- A very simple in-browser game. Simple graphics. Simple sound. But cool AI!
- All code in the 1 html file.

## Features
- Control your ship using the keyboard or mouse, but in a different way from the traditional "Asteroids" games. Uee the WASD or cursor keys to move the spaceship, and use the mouse to aim the ship's blaster. Press space or left click to shoot where the mouse pointer is aiming. I think this is a better way to control the ship than the old, keyboard-only setup. Do you?
- Crazy simple sound effects, with custom composed explosion sound, etc.
- CRAZY SPACE ACTION!
- Uses Tone library for sounds: https://tonejs.github.io/

## Generative AI features

Dynamic Mission Briefings and After-Action Reports, stories which will be **different** every time!!

**Dynamic Mission Briefings:** Each time you start a new game, a unique mission objective is generated by the Gemini API. You might be tasked with defending a mining colony, escorting a diplomat, or clearing a pirate blockade, adding a new narrative flavor to every session.

**After-Action Reports:** When your game is over, the screen smoothly fades to black, then immediately displays a cool high-tech loading screen with animated grids, progress bars, and status messages while Gemini generates a personalized, heroic "After-Action Report" based on your final score. The entire experience is seamless and entertaining for about 15 seconds. It's a fun way to commemorate a great run!

Both features include loading indicators while the AI generates the text.

**Uses the Gemini API** for the generative AI stories.

> **Example Mission Briefing:**
> 
>Urgent: The **Xylos Swarm** is assaulting the Jupiter Relay Station! Their bio-weapons will cripple our comms if they succeed. Protect the station at all costs, pilot! Wipe out every last alien before they breach our defenses!

> **Example After-Action Report:**
> 
>  **After-Action Report: Pilot Ensign Kira "Dodger" Bellweather**
>
>  Despite a final score of zero, Ensign Bellweather displayed a truly unparalleled mastery of evasive maneuvers during the recent engagement with the Xylosian raiders. Their craft, "The Indomitable Blip," became an almost mythical target, leading enemy fighters on a wild goose chase through the asteroid field and, according to post-mission comms, narrowly avoiding no fewer than seven head-on collisions with both hostile ships and conveniently placed galactic debris. While no hostile vessels were destroyed by their direct action, Ensign Bellweather's unique talent for *almost* being annihilated undoubtedly diverted a significant amount of enemy ordnance, effectively acting as the galaxy's most resilient, and frankly, luckiest, decoy. A true testament to the principle of "survival through sheer improbability.

## Instructions for Setup

Here are the steps to run the full version of the game from GitHub:

  1. Get a **Free API Key:** Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey): 
  2. **Create Key:** Click the "**Create API key**" button. You may need to sign in with your Google account.
  3. **Copy Key:** A new API key will be generated. **Copy this long string of letters and numbers.**
  4. **Update the Code:** Open the index.html file in a text editor and find this line:

```
const API_KEY = ""; // Leave blank
```
**Paste Your Key:** Paste your copied API key between the quotation marks:

```
const API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```
**Save and Run:** Save the file and open it in a web browser. **The mission briefings and after-action reports will now work.**

## Local Testing Setup

For developers who want to test the AI features without modifying the main `index.html` file, there's an automated local testing setup:

### Quick Local Testing
1. **Set up your API key (recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your actual API key
   ```
   Or manually create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Generate the local test file:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This automatically creates `local-index.html` from the main `index.html` file, inserts your API key, and opens it in your browser.

3. **Test AI features:** The file includes a "RUNNING LOCALLY" indicator and identical functionality to the main game

### Benefits of Automated Local Testing
- **Always up-to-date:** Local test file is automatically generated from the latest `index.html`
- **No maintenance:** No need to manually sync changes between files
- **Safe development:** Your API key stays local and won't be committed to GitHub
- **Identical functionality:** Same game features as the main version
- **No conflicts:** Doesn't affect the public GitHub Pages deployment
- **Auto-opens browser:** Generated file opens automatically for immediate testing

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Set up API key (one-time setup)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API key

# 2. Make changes to index.html
# 3. Generate fresh local test file with API key
npm run dev
# 4. Test AI features locally
```

The local test file is automatically excluded from version control to keep your API key secure.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
